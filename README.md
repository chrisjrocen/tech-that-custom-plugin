Question:

Create a custom plugin that adds a button at the bottom of every post (In the Frontend) and adds a metabox with a different button on the WP post admin edit screen. When clicked, both these buttons should have a counter they display that shows how many times the button has been clicked. The frontend counter is different from the backend one. The counter should be unique for each person, both on the front and backend. It should only show up for logged in users, even on the frontend. The saved value should also persist even when the page is reloaded. Guidelines:
The plugin should use composer for autoloading
It should use namespaces
It should use jQuery
